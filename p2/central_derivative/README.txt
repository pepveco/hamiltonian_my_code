The file `p2_central_derivative_no_corr.f90` implements a central-difference integration scheme for the case p = 2,
 designed to overcome the numerical instabilities encountered at high temperatures when using the Predictorâ€“Corrector (PC) algorithm. 
 These issues are specific to this setting and not related to the formulation proposed by Lorenzo Correale for p = 3.
